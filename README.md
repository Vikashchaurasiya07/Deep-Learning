# Deep-Learning
**Introduction**

- Deep learning is defined about to working on complexneural networks.This topic is subset if the machine learning

**Types of layer in Deep Learning**
1.Input Layer: 
Receives the raw data to the machine

2.Hidden Layer:
Perform the computations in the Hidden layer which is process tbe data


3.Out Layer
provude the final output and prediction on classification
