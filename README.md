# Deep-Learning
**Introduction**

- Deep learning is defined about to working on complexneural networks.This topic is subset if the machine learning

**Types of layer in Deep Learning**


1.Input Layer: 
Receives the raw data to the machine

2.Hidden Layer:
Perform the computations in the Hidden layer which is process tbe data


3.Out Layer
provude the final output and prediction on classification


**Activation function in Deep Learning**

1. ReLU (Rectified Liner Unit):
     Which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to spee up during training of the data

2. sigmoid:
   map the values binary(0 and 1 in the layer).

3.softmax:
  convert the raw data in to (score) convert into probability on the givendata.

**Back propogation and optimisation**

In this propogration step we use some of the example -mse( means standard error), cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data.
